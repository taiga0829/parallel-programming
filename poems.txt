Red eggs, green and white bunny, two kisses for a watering Bunny boy!
In fields of gold, a bunny's dance,
Red eggs gleam in morning's glance.
Green and white, its fur does sway,
Two kisses for a bunny's day.
Amidst the garden, colors bloom,
Red eggs nestled, dispelling gloom.
A bunny, green and white in hue,
With two kisses, love imbue.
Underneath the azure sky,
Red eggs gleam, a soft reply.
A bunny, green and white so fair,
Two kisses' warmth, beyond compare.
In the meadow, whispers hush,
Red eggs glow, a tender blush.
A bunny, green and white in stride,
Two kisses' joy, forever bide.
Within the grove where shadows play,
Red eggs rest in light of day.
A bunny, green and white with glee,
Two kisses given, pure and free.
Through fields of gold, a bunny hops,
Red eggs shine like sunrise drops.
Green and white, its form so coy,
Two kisses for a bunny's joy.
Beneath the moon's soft silver gleam,
Red eggs shimmer in a dream.
A bunny, green and white so bright,
Two kisses grace the velvet night.
In gardens where the breezes sigh,
Red eggs gleam like fireflies.
A bunny, green and white in grace,
Two kisses weave a tender lace.
Amongst the blossoms, sweet perfume,
Red eggs glow, dispelling gloom.
A bunny, green and white so dear,
Two kisses whisper, "stay near."
In fields where daisies gently sway,
Red eggs herald a brand-new day.
A bunny, green and white, so true,
Two kisses, love forever renew.
